## Abstract

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained widespread adoption owing to its capacity to empower large language models (LLMs) to integrate external knowledge. However, existing RAG frameworks are primarily designed for text-based LLMs and rely on Automatic Speech Recognition to process speech input, which discards crucial audio information, risks transcription errors, and increases computational overhead. Therefore, we introduce WavRAG, the first retrieval augmented generation framework with native, end-to-end audio support.

## Key Contributions

- **First RAG framework with native, end-to-end audio support**
- **Bypasses ASR** by directly processing raw audio for both embedding and retrieval
- **Integrates audio and text** into unified knowledge representation
- **Introduces WavRetriever** for text-audio hybrid knowledge base retrieval
- **Achieves 10x acceleration** compared to ASR-Text RAG pipelines

## Main Research Question

How to develop a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) framework that can effectively integrate external knowledge for large language models (LLMs) in spoken dialogue systems, while overcoming the limitations of existing RAG frameworks that rely on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and discard crucial audio information.

## Key Methodology

The authors propose WavRAG, a novel RAG framework with two key features:

1. **Native, End-to-End Audio Support**: WavRAG bypasses ASR and directly processes raw audio for both embedding and retrieval, eliminating the need for transcription and reducing computational overhead.

2. **Text-Audio Hybrid Knowledge Representation**: WavRAG integrates audio and text into a unified knowledge representation, enabling the retrieval of relevant information from a text-audio hybrid knowledge base.

The framework includes:
- **WavRetriever**: A component that enables retrieval of relevant audio and text information
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning**: Enhances the in-context capabilities of spoken dialogue models

## Major Findings and Results

1. **Comparable Retrieval Performance**: WavRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance to ASR-Text RAG pipelines
2. **10x Acceleration**: WavRAG delivers a 10x acceleration compared to ASR-Text RAG pipelines, demonstrating computational efficiency
3. **Unique Text-Audio Hybrid Retrieval**: Extends the boundaries of RAG to the audio modality

## Significance and Implications

The introduction of WavRAG has significant implications for:

1. **Speech Recognition**: Eliminates the need for transcription, reducing errors and improving performance
2. **Audio-Based Dialogue Systems**: Enables more effective audio-based dialogue systems
3. **Multimodal Interaction**: Paves the way for sophisticated multimodal interaction systems

## Notable Limitations

1. **Audio Embedding**: May require further optimization to improve performance
2. **Knowledge Base Construction**: Requires significant resources and expertise
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: May not fully capture the complexities of spoken dialogue systems

## Conclusion

WavRAG represents a significant advancement in RAG frameworks for spoken dialogue systems, offering native, end-to-end audio support and text-audio hybrid retrieval capabilities. Its implications for speech recognition, audio-based dialogue systems, and multimodal interaction are substantial.
