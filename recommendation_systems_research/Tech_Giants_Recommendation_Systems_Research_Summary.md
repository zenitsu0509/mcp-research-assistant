## Paper 1: Collaborative Multi-modal Deep Learning for Facebook Marketplace

**Authors:** Lu Zheng, Zhao Tan, Kun Han, Ren Mao (Facebook)  
**Published:** May 31, 2018  
**ArXiv ID:** 1805.12312  
**Category:** Information Retrieval (cs.IR)  

### Executive Summary

Facebook Marketplace's recommendation system addresses two critical challenges in customer-to-customer (C2C) e-commerce: **scalability** and the **cold start problem**. The system must process tens of thousands of products and serve millions of users within milliseconds while dealing with short product lifespans and sparse user interactions.

### Key Innovation

The research introduces a **collaborative multi-modal deep learning based retrieval system** that combines:
- Collaborative filtering techniques
- Multi-modal content information (text, images, metadata)
- Compact user and product embeddings

### Technical Architecture

- **Multi-modal Learning:** Leverages product images, descriptions, and categorical information
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Incorporates user interaction patterns and preferences  
- **Embedding Generation:** Creates compact representations for both users and products
- **Real-time Processing:** Handles massive scale with sub-second response times

### Performance Results

#### Online Experiments (Production Impact)
- **+26.95%** increase in buyer-to-seller message initiation
- Significant improvement in user engagement and marketplace activity

#### Offline Experiments (Model Accuracy)
- **+9.58%** improvement in prediction accuracy
- Superior performance compared to baseline recommendation methods

### Business Impact

- Enhanced user experience on Facebook Marketplace
- Increased transaction volume and user engagement  
- Solved critical scalability challenges for C2C commerce
- Effective cold start handling for new products and users

### Challenges Addressed

1. **Scalability:** Processing tens of thousands of products for millions of users daily
2. **Cold Start:** Handling new products with minimal interaction data
3. **Short Product Lifespan:** Adapting to rapidly changing inventory
4. **Sparse Interactions:** Making recommendations with limited user-product data

## Paper 2: NxtPost - Facebook Groups Recommendation System

**Authors:** Kaushik Rangadurai, Yiqun Liu, Siddarth Malreddy, Xiaoyi Liu, Piyush Maheshwari, Vishwanath Sangale, Fedor Borisyuk (Facebook)  
**Published:** February 8, 2022  
**ArXiv ID:** 2202.03645  
**Category:** Machine Learning (cs.LG)  

### Executive Summary

NxtPost is a **deployed user-to-post content-based sequential recommender system** for Facebook Groups, leveraging Transformer architecture to predict user interests in dynamic social content environments.

### Key Innovation

**Transformer-Based Sequential Recommendation:** Adapts modern NLP advances to social content recommendation, using causal masked multi-head attention to capture both short-term and long-term user interests.

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components
- **Transformer Architecture:** Causal masked multi-head attention mechanism
- **Sequential Learning:** Models user interaction sequences over time
- **External Embeddings:** Handles large vocabulary without fixed corpus constraints
- **Dynamic Content Handling:** Adapts to constantly changing post content

#### Safety and Ethics Integration
- Validated safety processes for user activity analysis
- Responsible recommendation practices for social content

### Performance Results

#### Model Performance
- **49%** absolute improvement in offline evaluation metrics
- Superior performance over previous sequential recommendation methods

#### Business Metrics
- **+0.6%** increase in users meeting new people
- Enhanced community engagement and knowledge sharing
- Improved user support and social connections

### Real-World Deployment Insights

The paper provides valuable lessons from production deployment:

1. **Cold Start Handling:** Effective strategies for new users with limited activity
2. **Content Freshness:** Balancing recent posts with relevant historical content  
3. **A/B Testing Optimization:** Efficient experimentation strategies for online systems
4. **Scalability Considerations:** Performance tuning for large-scale social networks

### Business Impact

- **Community Building:** More users connecting and engaging within Groups
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Improved content discovery for educational and informational posts
- **User Retention:** Enhanced user experience leading to increased platform engagement
- **Social Support:** Better matching of users with relevant support communities

### Technical Innovations

1. **External Item Embeddings:** Extends sequence-based approaches to large vocabularies
2. **Dynamic Content Modeling:** Handles constantly evolving post content
3. **Multi-timescale Attention:** Optimizes both immediate and long-term user interests
4. **Production-Ready Architecture:** Deployment lessons for real-world systems
